intro: >-
  David Keith Stanley is an illustrator living in North Carolina serving
  editorial, advertising, and institutional clients both at home and abroad. In
  addition to the U.S., David's work has taken him to five different countries,
  drawing for esteemed clients such as GE, Coca-Cola, Disney, Gap, Mars, Baldwin
  Richardson, Lowes Foods, Hanes Brands, Freisland Campina, Prophet, Leo
  Burnett, and many others. At East Carolina University, David majored in
  communication art with a concentration in illustration. After a decade or so
  working in the industry he furthered his education with two summers at
  Virginia Commonwealth University's Illustration Academy. But his most relevant
  and adventurous education has come through working for over a quarter century
  on countless interesting projects for so many terrific clients. He loves
  bringing ideas to life, whether it's with a purple crayon or a digital stylus.
  Whether its for an innovation workshop at a Fortune 500 company or an
  editorial illustration for a compelling magazine story, he has found a
  terrific application of his gift and passion. A selection of honors include
  national recognition with the Society of Illustrators in New York and Los
  Angeles, Graphic Design USA, and the International Society of Caricature
  Artists, as well as receiving several local awards. David has also taught
  drawing in both corporate and university settings such as GE's Management
  Development Institute in Crotonville, NY and University of North Carolina
  School of the Arts in Winston-Salem, NC. He loves to work with students to
  help them develop their skills of drawing and observation. His incredible
  wife, Greta, and three stupendous children can attest that he consumes obscene
  amounts of coffee, escapes outdoors with them whenever possible, and can
  hardly be separated from his sketchbook. As his mom has been known to say,
  "He's been drawing since he was able to hold a pencil".
