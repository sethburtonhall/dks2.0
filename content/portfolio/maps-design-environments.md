title: 'Maps, Design, & Environments'
description: >-
  Some of the most interesting and challenging projects I've had the privilege
  of working on have been maps.  I'm not a cartographer, but I have enjoyed the
  rather enchanting confluence of geography, minutiae, and quirkiness that these
  projects present.  Also featured here are a few examples of conceptual
  environments for clients as well as corporate identity work. I believe good
  design is a solid foundation for illustration, especially in relation to
  perspective, architecture, typography, and branding.  Have a look!
