description: >-
  Howard Cosell said that sports are a microcosm of life.  I’ve had numerous
  occasions to explore the drama and adventure of this truth over the years.  In
  each one of these images I feel I’ve “drawn” from a part of my own experience,
  my own passion for the game, and perhaps they each tell a small piece of my
  own story.  Suit up and scroll with me onto the field.
