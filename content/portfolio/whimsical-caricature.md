title: Whimsical & Caricature
description: >-
  My portfolio, indeed my entire artistic career would be eminently incomplete
  without humor and specifically, caricature.  In addition to studio
  assignments, I have also enjoyed many years of drawing live for events-- great
  for sharpening the skills of observation and interpretation.  Plus it makes
  for outrageous and expeditious entertainment!  Here you will see work for
  clients such as Our State and Outdoor Life Magazine, Corcoran Printing,
  Goodwill Industries, Krispy Kreme, and others.  A picture is worth a thousand
  laughs!
