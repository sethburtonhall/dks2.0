description: >-
  Ideas are powerful.  Juice them up with illustration and they become
  exponentially more so.  An elegant visual can turbocharge the imagination. 
  I’ve had the privilege of working with many Fortune 500 and 1000 companies
  around the globe, often in collaboration with red hot creative consultancies
  such Prophet, The Lindstrom Company, and Two Monkeys to craft their visual
  story.  It is truly an adventure to bring my passion for beauty and
  storytelling and mingle it with the aspirations of great companies such as GE,
  Coca Cola, or Disney to capture and articulate their lofty insights with color
  and moxie and visceral appeal.  Below you will see a mix of studio and live
  work—digital and traditional.  I am evolving towards an all-digital platform,
  however, I will always chiefly value drawing skill and problem-solving acumen
  whatever the medium.  Scroll through my imagination and give this gallery a
  gander.
