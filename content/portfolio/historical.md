description: '  There will never be a shortage of fascinating historical content.  Many of the   images here stem from my phenomenal relationship with Our State Magazine and   the exceptional array of topics they dream up.  Even within North Carolinaâ€™s   borders alone, history is a vast country to be explored.  As with most of my   work, all of the illustrations here are either oil, pastel, or digital. Scroll   down and take a stroll with me through the past.'
