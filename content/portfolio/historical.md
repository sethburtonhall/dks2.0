  There will never be a shortage of fascinating historical content.  Many of the
  images here stem from my phenomenal relationship with Our State Magazine and
  the exceptional array of topics they dream up.  Even within North Carolina’s
  borders alone, history is a vast country to be explored.  As with most of my
  work, all of the illustrations here are either oil, pastel, or digital. Scroll
  down and take a stroll with me through the past.
